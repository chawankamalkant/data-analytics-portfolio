Hospital Management System – MySQL Project

This project contains a complete Hospital Management Database built using MySQL. It includes tables for patients, doctors, appointments, treatments, and billing, along with sample data and a wide range of SQL queries for analysis.

The database demonstrates key SQL concepts including table creation, relationships using foreign keys, CRUD operations, joins, aggregate functions, date-based filtering, subqueries, and reporting queries.
All queries are designed to reflect real-world hospital operations such as scheduling appointments, recording treatments, generating billing amounts, and analyzing patient/doctor information.
